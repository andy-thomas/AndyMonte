TO DO:
Create GitHub repository and save to repository - done
Why does counter reset - is there a better way to display elapsed time? - done
Save to a single table per project, or single partition?
iterationCount - make common or make part of project?
Report elapsed time on project summary
Refactor common code (data source, task aggregator, etc)
Allow user to specify number of worker processes
Why does loop to write queue messages take so long?
Multi-thread the calculations - take batches of projects and calculate a batch, each one asynchronously
Specify queue, blob and table names when constructing data source - can we make this more efficient?
Put refresh periods (waiting page, worker roles) into config settings
Put number of chart points into config setting
Clear out data from storage before run if..
When user enters project data, ask whether to "overwrite existing project if exists"
